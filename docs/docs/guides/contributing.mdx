Thank you for your interest in contributing to Reanimated! From commenting on and triaging issues, through extending the documentation, to reviewing and sending Pull Requests, all contributions are more than welcome.

## Ways to Contribute

1. **Replying and handling open issues** &ndash; great way to contribute without writing a single line of code is triaging the issues. We often get issues that have generic errors, occur only in very specific cases, do not have proper example or reproducible repository. One of they way to help is preparing and filling those details, which will help other contributors get up to speed with the issue faster.

2. **Helping with documentation** &ndash; helping with the documentation can be as simple as checking for speling and grammer. If you encounter situations that can be explained better or in more details, click **Edit this page** at the bottom of most pages to get started with your own contribution. You can also help updating the page structures from old versions, as some of them are still ported from Reanimated v2 docs. Read more about [helping with documentation](#helping-with-documentation).

3. **Reviewing pull requests** &ndash; reviewing Pull Requests is crucial as it may help catch the corner cases or bugs that the contributor didn't notice. Every review matters as it may help us polish quality of the library.

4. **Contributing to Code** &ndash; Code-level contributions generally come in the form of pull requests. By contributing to code you help us with solving issues, fixing bugs or introducing new amazing features. If you want to start your adventure with open source it's good idea to take a look at [good first issue](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) on github. Read more about [contributing to code](#contributing-to-code).

## Handling open issues

Often understanding and reproducing the problem can be very time consuming task. The great way to help other contributors get up to the speed with solving an issue is providing detailed description and _reproducible_ example. The github already has an template for creating issue, nevertheless we still encounter issues that do not have all necessary details, like:

- repository that we can clone and quickly see the problem,
- very generic reproduction steps,
- missing description,
- not related or truncated stack trace.

What you can do is ask the owner for those details or try provide them by yourself - try to reproduce the problem and provide missing details, so other developer can start debugging straightaway! ðŸŽ‰

## Helping with documentation

One of many ways you can contribute to this project is by extending documentation. We try to keep it up to date, but there is still plenty room for improvement. It is also important to update the docs whenever you introduce changes to the API or you discover any inconsistency in current API or behavior. This is also one of the simplest way to contribute, as some of our docs are still in v2 format, so you can help us convert them to Reanimated 3 structure.

The Reanimated documentation is hosted using docusaurus and GitHub Pages. The easiest way to start adding your changes it by clicking **Edit this page** located at the bottom of most pages.

### Editing source locally

If you want to introduce more complicated changes it is worth to edit it locally, this way you can utilize live preview to make sure everything will look as expected for the end users. To start please follow the steps below:

1. Read [How to Open a Pull Request](https://reactnative.dev/contributing/how-to-open-a-pull-request)
2. Clone [react-native-reanimated](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated/)
3. `yarn`
4. `cd docs`
5. `yarn`
6. `yarn start`

This will start your local docusaurus server hosting documentation.

### Project structure

Here you can find the most important parts of the `react-native-reanimated/docs` project. Not all folders are listed, as most of them is not intended to be changed.

1. `docs/` - contains folder with md/mdx files, each folder is a section in the side navigation, and each file is documentation page
2. `src/examples` - contains examples that are later presented in the documentation
3. `src/components` - contains components used to make the pages interactive
4. `static/recordings` - contains video recordings of the examples
5. `static/img` - contains images used in the docs

### Documentation page structure

It is important to keep the page structure consistent, this help developers easily navigate and quickly find what they are looking for. In the v3 of documentation, we assume given structure:

1. **Introduction** &ndash; short introduction what given feature does.
2. **Reference** &ndash; simplest possible usage showcase and type definitions, make sure that example code runs when someone copies it to quickly prototype.
3. **Arguments** &ndash; details about the arguments that given method accepts.
4. **Returns** &ndash; details of returned values.
5. **Example** &ndash; video, gif or interactive demo with source code. It is good practice to provide resources in both light and dark mode.
6. **Remarks** &ndash; make sure to highlight everything that might not be obvious i.e. platform specific quirks, compatibility issues, additional setups required.
7. **Platform compatibility** &ndash; information about platforms that given feature supports.

The structure may vary depending on given feature. If the one above doesn't seem to be good fit for you, try to find similar feature and see how it is documented.

### Embedding interactive examples

We try to make the examples as easy for the users as it gets. This is why good, interactive examples are crucial. To create great examples you can use `InteractiveExample` component. It takes `src` prop that expects source of a component that you can declare in `src/examples`, and a prop `component` that showcase given code.

#### Example with a video

```javascript
import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';
import AnimatedKeyboardSrc from '!!raw-loader!@site/src/examples/AnimatedKeyboard';

<InteractiveExample
  src={AnimatedKeyboardSrc}
  component={
    <ThemedVideo
      center
      width={300}
      sources={{
        light: '/recordings/useAnimatedKeyboard_light.mov',
        dark: '/recordings/useAnimatedKeyboard_dark.mov',
      }}
    />
  }
/>;
```

#### Example with an interactive component

```javascript
import DecayTrain from '@site/src/examples/DecayTrain';
import DecayTrainSrc from '!!raw-loader!@site/src/examples/DecayTrain';

<InteractiveExample
  src={DecayTrainSrc}
  component={<DecayTrain />}
  label="Grab and drag the train"
/>;
```

## Contributing to Code

Posting Pull Requests to the issues is great way to contribute to Reanimated. If you eager to start contributing right away, we have list of [good first issue](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) that contain bugs which have limited scope. In this section we'll describe in more details how to play around with Reanimated setup.

:::caution

Make sure that you have [React Native setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) properly and you got familiar with [How to Open a Pull Request](https://reactnative.dev/contributing/how-to-open-a-pull-request) before reading this section further.

:::

We have shared code of example app, that is run on different platforms and architectures. When working on an issue the most important destinations will be:

- `app` &ndash; shared source code with example app
- `src/reanimated2` &ndash; containing source code related to JS part of Reanimated features
- `android/src/main/java/com/swmansion/reanimated` &ndash; containing source code related to Android native part of Reanimated features
- `apple` &ndash; containing source code related to iOS native part of Reanimated features

Our workflow usually starts from editing `app/src/examples/EmptyExample.tsx` with testing example for our new feature or a bug. This is the part that we often attach to PR so other developers can test the same use-case. Next, we run the `Example` (or `FabricExample` depending on the architecture) app and start development.

:::info

If you want implement new feature or fix bug, but still feal uninformed, after reading through this section, or could use a guidance you can reach Reanimated Team on [discord](https://discord.com/channels/464786597288738816/1216675825584181330).

### Preparing Pull Request

When your code changes are ready, it is time to open your Pull Request. Github already has a template that helps you properly post your changes. The most crucial are:

1. **Summary**:

- If you're solving specific issue, start with linking it.
- Write what are your motivations, and how you solved the problem.
- If applicable it's great idea to attach screen or video before and after changes.

2. **Test plan** &ndash; Describe how others can test your change, here we usually attach the code from your modified `EmptyExample`, that you used for testing.

### Testing changes in your project

If you want to test changes in your own project the best way is to create patch using `git diff` or pointing to specific commit in your `package.json`.

See you on GitHub! ðŸŽ‰
