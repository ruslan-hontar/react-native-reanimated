## Handling open issues 

## Helping with documentation 

One of many ways you can contribute to this project is by extending documentation. We try to keep it up to date, but there is still plenty room for improvement. It is also important to update the docs whenever you introduce changes to the API or you discover any inconsistency in current API or behavior. This is also one of the simplest way to contribute, as some of our docs are still in v2 format, so you can help us convert them to Reanimated 3 page structure.

The Reanimated documentation is hosted using docusaurus and GitHub Pages. The easiest way to start adding your changes it by clicking "Edit this page" at the bottom of each page.

### Editing source locally

If you want to introduce more complicated changes it is worth to edit it locally, this way you can utilize live preview to make sure everything will look as expected for the end users. To start please follow the steps below: 

1. Read How to Open a Pull Request // TODO: link
2. Clone [react-native-reanimated](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated/)
3. `yarn`
4. `cd docs`
5. `yarn`
6. `yarn start`

This will start your local docusaurus server hosting documentation.

### Project structure

Here you can find the most important parts of the `react-native-reanimated/docs` project. Not all folders are listed, as most of them is not intended to be changed. 

1. `docs/` - contains folder with md/mdx files, each folder is a section in the side navigation, and each file is documentation page
2. `src/examples` - contains examples that are later presented in the documentation
3. `src/components` - contains components used to make the pages interactive
4. `static/recordings` - containts video recordings of the examples

### Documentation page structure

It is important to keep the page structure consistant, this help developers easly navigate and quickly find what they are looking for. In the v3 of documentation, we assume given structure:

1. **Introduction** &ndash; short introduction what given feature does.
2. **Reference** &ndash; simplest possible usage showcase and type definitions, make sure that example code runs when someone copies it to quickly prototype.
3. **Arguments** &ndash; details about the arguments that given method accepts.
4. **Returns** &ndash; details of retunred values.
5. **Example** &ndash; video, gif or interacive demo with source code. It is good practice to provide resoruces in both light and dark mode. 
6. **Remarks** &ndash; make sure to highlight everything that might not be obvious i.e. platform specififc quirks, compatibility issues, additional setup required. 
7. **Platform compatibility** &ndash; information about platforms that given feature supports.

The structure may vary depending on given feature. If the one above doesn't seem to be good fit for you, try to find similar feature and see how it is documented. 

### Embeding examples

We try to make the examples as easy for the users as it gets. This is why good, interactive examples are crucial. To create great examples you can use `InteractiveExample` component, it takse `src` prop that expects source of a component that you can declare in `src/examples` and a`component` that showcase given code.

#### Example with a video 

```javascript
import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';
import AnimatedKeyboardSrc from '!!raw-loader!@site/src/examples/AnimatedKeyboard';

<InteractiveExample
  src={AnimatedKeyboardSrc}
  component={
    <ThemedVideo
      center
      width={300}
      sources={{
        light: '/recordings/useAnimatedKeyboard_light.mov',
        dark: '/recordings/useAnimatedKeyboard_dark.mov',
      }}
    />
  }
/>
```
#### Example with an interactive component 

```javascript
import DecayTrain from '@site/src/examples/DecayTrain';
import DecayTrainSrc from '!!raw-loader!@site/src/examples/DecayTrain';

<InteractiveExample
  src={DecayTrainSrc}
  component={<DecayTrain />}
  label="Grab and drag the train"
/>
```

## Reviewing Pull Requests 

## Contributing to Code

Posting Pull Requests to the issues is great way to contribute to Reanimated. If you eager to start contributing right away, we have list of good first issues (// TODO: Add) that contain bugs which have limited scope. In this section we'll describe in more details how to play around with Reanimated setup. 

:::caution

Make sure that you have [React Native setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)  properly and you got familiar with [How to Open a Pull Request](https://reactnative.dev/contributing/how-to-open-a-pull-request) before reading this section further. 

:::

When workin on an issue the most important destinations will be:

- `src/reanimated2` &ndash; containing source code related to JS part of Reanimated features
- `android/src/main/java/com/swmansion/reanimated` &ndash; containing source code related to Android native part of Reanimated features
- `apple` &ndash; containing source code related to iOS native part of Reanimated features

Our workflow usually starts from editing `app/src/examples/EmptyExample.tsx` with testing example for our new feature or a bug. This is the part that we often attach to PR so other developers can test the same usecase. Next we run the `Example` (or `FabricExample` depending on the architecture) app and start development.
